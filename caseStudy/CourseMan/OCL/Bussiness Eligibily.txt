OCL eligibility: govern qualification criteria for resource access based on actor attributes and history. They enforce: 
1. Novice access limitation: Limiting novice actors from accessing advanced resources without authorization
Restrict access to advanced resources for new students/novice actors without approval.
2. Minimum performance for additional allocation: Requiring minimum performance metrics for additional resource allocation
Require minimum performance levels (e.g. GPA) and approval before allocating additional resources (overload/extra capacity).
3.  Sufficient progress before specialization: Ensuring sufficient progress before accessing specialized resources
Only allow access to specialized/specific resources (thesis, capstone…) when cumulative progress reaches a threshold (\eg ≥ 80% of total program credits).
4.  Foundational-before-advanced mandate: Mandating successful completion of foundational experiences before advanced ones
Completion of foundational experience (\eg internship with minimum C) is required before participating in advanced experience (thesis).
5. Required credentials for specialized resources: Validating that actors possess all required credentials for specialized resources.
Only allow access to specific/sensitive resources when the required credentials are present for that resource.

OCL Size constraints:Govern resource allocation based on participant quantity thresholds:
1. Ensuring resources have sufficient participants to operate effectively; 
2. Preventing oversubscription while allowing exceptions for essential resources; 
3. Implementing multi-criteria sorting when demand exceeds capacity;
4. Triggering alternative resource management strategies when minimum thresholds aren't met;
5.  Enforcing state changes for resources that fail to meet participation requirements.

OCL Derived constraints: govern derived constraints defining calculated properties based on existing data. They establish:
1. Computing performance metrics using value-weight products;
2. Determining progress thresholds based on proportional completion;
3. Calculating remaining capacity in constrained environments;
4. Determining current state based on temporal and quantitative conditions;
5. Tracking unsuccessful attempts for specific resources.
